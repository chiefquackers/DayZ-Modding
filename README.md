# DayZ Expansion Modding


Useful files and folders for the DayZ Expansion


I have created this repository due to the lack of useful content I could find relating to the DayZ Expansion Traders and Markets plus various other useful file structures that might aid someone else. 

I will continue to try and update this as more information follows and will help those that need it over on my discord channel, where you will also find more useful information and server details regarding the servers I own and maintain. 

For those looking for support, head over to my discord and drop a message there
